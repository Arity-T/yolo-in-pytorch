# YOLOv1 in PyTorch
PyTorch implementation of a prominent Object Detection model
([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640.pdf)). The project was implemented for
educational purposes and provides extremely limited functionality (check the 
[YOLOv5 repo](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) if you are looking for object 
detector that can be used in production).
